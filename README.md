# SafeEats

Update: 04/14/2021
Updated all pages to .ejs to allow for incorporating the use of express, node, and postgresql. Still need to get full functionality, and do styling. Current pages on in Working in EJS branch.


I am working on getting all of the html pages designed and getting the API tied in to do searches. It is still very much a work in progress. I can link to my API in the console with static data, but not with inputed data yet and I still have a lot of styling to do and clean up.



The purpose of this web application is to give an easy to use application for people who are needing to eliminate allergens to quickly search a food database to give them ideas of safe foods or to check if a particular food is safe. 

Safe Eats will be a web application that allows users to register for an account and then they will select allergens to eliminate. This will search a database and return allergen safe foods. Optionally, they will be able to input a food name and find out if that food is safe. Future versions will include an option to save the allergens and the searches that are made. 

***The user has the ultimate responsibility of verifying any information recieved in the searches.***
