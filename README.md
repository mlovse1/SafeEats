# SafeEats
The purpose of this web application is to give an easy to use application for people who are needing to eliminate allergens to quickly search a food database to give them ideas of safe foods or to check if a particular food is safe. 

Safe Eats will be a web application that allows users to register for an account and then they will select allergens to eliminate. This will search a database and return allergen safe foods. Optionally, they will be able to input a food name and find out if that food is safe. Future versions will include an option to save the allergens and the searches that are made. 

***The user has the ultimate responsibility of verifying any information recieved in the searches.***
